CS 624 â€“ Sketch Recognition (Dr. Hammond)
Project # 01

THE FOLDER CONTAINS:
1 - Python file (*.py)
2 - Paper (*.pdf)
3 - This README (*.txt)
4 - requirements (*.txt)

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN
1 - Open project1.py in an editor
2 - Make sure that all the required packages from the 'requirements.txt' are install on python
3 - In project1.py, edit these variables:
    arrows_path = give the whole path to arrows.json, as raw string. (like  r'E:\Users\Dell\...\Project 1\Training\Arrows\arrows.json') 
    other_path = give the whole path to other.json, as raw string. (like  r'E:\Users\Dell\...\Project 1\Training\Other\other.json') 
    all_features_csv_path = give the whole path to save first csv which has all the features, as raw string. 
                           (like  r'E:\Users\Dell\...\Project 1\all_features.csv') --> This will create 'all_features.csv' in 'Project 1' after 
                            the execution of the program
    subset_features_csv_path = give the whole path to save second csv which has subset of the features, as raw string. 
                              (like  r'E:\Users\Dell\...\Project 1\subset_features.csv') --> This will create 'subset_features.csv' in 'Project 1' after 
                               the execution of the program.
4 - After editing these variables, save the program and run it.
5 - Wait till the program prints out 'All the CSV's are created' (It takes ~14 minutes for the given dataset to pre-process, create all features and save to csv)
6 - Use the corresponding csv's from given folder to load in WEKA and run various classifiers
7 - Please, feel free to contact anything. My contact information is on the first line.

Thank you very much!
